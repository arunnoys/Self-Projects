Workers variety industries, healthcare agriculture manufacturing, expect witness hiring disruptions result Artificial Intelligence. history taught anything, disruptive paradigm-shifting business ideas make fortune innovators, build groundwork business models, market entrants, job opportunities inevitably follow. true robots today future eventually replace humans jobs, innovative farming equipment humans horses industrial revolution. jobs humans end here. We, hand, required generate provide ways business models result changes. 71% businesses worldwide, Artificial Intelligence people overcome critical challenging problems live lives. Artificial Intelligence consultants work equally fair, whopping 83% corporate leaders. results demonstrate Artificial Intelligence steadily extending measures, yielding societal benefits allowing citizens live fulfilling lives. Increase Automation Jobs humans can’t compete advent Industry 4.0, businesses moving fast pace automation, type industry. 2013, researchers oxford university study future work. concluded jobs high risk automated machines. Machine learning responsible disruption. powerful branch artificial intelligence. machines learn data mimic things humans do. research conducted employees Kaggle algorithm created images human eye diagnose eye disease diabetic retinopathy. Here, winning algorithm match diagnosis human ophthalmologists. study conducted algorithm created grade high school essays. too, winning algorithm match grade human teachers. Thus, safely conclude data, machines easily outperform human beings tasks these. teacher read 10,000 essays 40-year career; ophthalmologist 50,000 eyes machine read million essays million eyes minutes. Thus, convenient conclude chance competing machines frequent, high volume tasks. Tasks machines don’t work tasks human beings upper hand, is, tasks. Machines can’t handle things haven’t times before. fundamental rule machine learning learns large volumes past data. humans don’t; ability seemingly connecting disparate threads solve problems haven’t before.

Thus, machines compete tackling situations. 92% talented professionals soft skills human interactions fostering relationships matter hard skills successful managing workplace. Perhaps, kind tasks machines compete humans at. Also, creative tasks: copy marketing campaign grab customers’ attention stand crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps market working them. machines outperform humans tasks, humans creating campaigns strategies. Human contact essential care-giving educational-related work responsibilities, technology backseat. Health screenings customer service face-to-face communication advocate human contact, Artificial Intelligence playing supporting role. So, future work? future state single job lies answer single question: extent job reducible tackling frequent high-volume tasks extent involve tackling situations? Today machines diagnose diseases grade exam papers, coming years they’re conduct audits, they’re read boilerplate legal contracts. we’re needing accountants lawyers? Wrong. We’re complex tax structuring, path breaking litigation. tougher jobs machine learning shrink ranks. Amazon recruited 100,000 robots warehouses move goods products effectively, warehouse workforce expanded 80,000 people.

Yes! Humans examples intelligent entities. Thus, 1900s, researchers began exploring thought process, reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent. Mimicking human behavior aim AI initial years research. setting goal, studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test!

Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims. humans recognize daily life objects. animal, easily recognize “dog” “cat”. trivial task wondered mind it? answer Generalization! picture dog, easily recognize picture dog, because, minds abstracted description dog formulated “concept” dog concepts learned past experiences dog. So, dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds. generalization only, real “information”. So, give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data own. Statistics: discipline concerns collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, presentation data. Statistics deal data aim explain it. So, study explaining data itself! Statistics main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data “Descriptive” statistics. explain information possible, easily large data complex task otherwise. Inferential statistics make accurate inferences small data. inference tasks daily lives. simple case cooking soup. completing recipe, taste small sample, is, spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad. Depending result sample, make inference soup soup whole, good bad. Similarly, statistics, cases apply inference meaningful information. example, case gather data time-consuming costly. cases, applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty. inferential statistics help. So, data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals with. So, however, data, statistics explain data. aim resonate AI ML, statistics fields correctly interpret data! Data Mining: “Data”, raw form. examples sensors industrial applications. sensors manufacturing plant sense properties temperature, pressure, etc. raw data generated sensors converted suitable form, processed, analyzed gather valuable insights, solve problem! Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets, gather insights, Data Mining referred “Knowledge Discovery”. why, Carly Fiorina, CEO Hewlett-Packard said, “The goal turn data information information Insight”. statement completely explains aim Data Mining! So, difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims. approaches fields, fulfilling aims fields. beauty fields!

Whilst made tremendous progress understanding brain activity years, research hasn’t answer questions relating nature emotions experiences.

William James, American psychologist, differentiated consciousness stream – unbroken continuous shifts. main center lot analysis moved strictly note cable behaviors primary half twentieth century, analysis human consciousness grown staggeringly 1950s. Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory, believed levels awareness- preconscious, conscious, unconscious responsible one’s behavior thinking. believed mid divided parts- id, ego, superego. Id present birth, instinctual, operates pleasure principle. ego underseals reality logic develops id infancy. Finally, superego internalization society’s moral standards responsible guilt. Now, Id regarded unconscious, ego superego conscious preconscious.
